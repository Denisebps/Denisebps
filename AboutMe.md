## About me

Found out my passion for coding in 2016 during my Ph.D. It grew so strong that I decided to change my thesis.

After changing from a bachelor's in Agronomy to a master's in Geography and then to a Ph.D. in Business Administration, I finally had found my passion, what I wanted to do to live.

You know one of those people that looks like they have it all planned from early on? Well, I'm not one of those - if we are talking about my professional career. The truth is that when I entered college, I didn't know what I wanted to do. But little by little started to figure it out.

First public policy and public administration from the agriculture point of view, then food security and school feeding all entangled. Data was there, in the ton of excel spreadsheets and the lots of consults to the government. I changed fields, but not subjects.

In my thesis, working with big data and the public purchases for the Brazilian school feeding program was an enormous task. However, it was pleasant and made me grow a lot. I finally found out what I want to do when I grow up - only I already have grown.

And that is how I got here. Now I'm a data scientist and continually am studying to improve my skills.
